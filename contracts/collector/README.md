# Collector

**NOTE**: Reference documentation for this contract is available [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@anchor-protocol/s/anchor-2/smart-contracts/anchor-token/collector).

The Collector accumulates Glow protocol fees and swaps them to GLOW through the GLOW <> UST Terraswap pair. Swapped GLOW tokens are distributed to GLOW stakers (sent to [Gov contract](../gov)).
